        <h2> This is the last page</h2>
        <p>Thank you for reading patiently~</p>
        <p> Baby.This year's Qixi Festival, we are not in the same place, nor can we hold hands and go shopping like other couples, eat desserts 
            together, and take a bunch of silly photos. You are in Australia, and I am in Malaysia, separated by the sea and time, but do you 
            know that none of these have made my heart farther away from you.I often think that if I had the ability to teleport now, I would 
            definitely run to you without hesitation, throw myself into your arms, feel your real temperature, and make up for the thoughts 
            of this period of time at once. Even if we just sit on the sofa and watch a movie together or do nothing, I feel very happy.We all 
            know that LDR are not easy. Sometimes you are busy with your things, and I am busy with mine. The time difference makes our chat not 
            always so smooth, sometimes I miss you so muchn that I can't sleep, and I want to send a message, but I'm afraid to disturb your rest. 
            But I found that loving someone is very wonderful, even if it is hard, even if it is a little wrong, the heart will still be filled 
            with warmth, because I know that the person is you.During the days you were in Australia, I imagine what you were doing. When you were
            walking down the street and a breeze blew by, would you squint your eyes? When you were eating, would you think that the dish would 
            taste better if I were there? When you saw beautiful scenery, would you secretly hope that I could be by your side to see it together? 
            Did you eat well? Did you sleep well? Did you look at other beautiful girls? We are far apart, but the moon we look up to is the 
            same. Just like our hearts, no matter how far apart we are, we will still get closer to each other and attract each other.I was 
            thinking that when we meet next time, I will hug you for a long time and tell you how much I miss you during this period; I will 
            take you to eat what you like to eat and what I like to eat, go to the places we want to go, and take a lot of photos to make up 
            for all the missed days.I hope we can spend every festival together in the future not only Qixi Festival, without time differences, 
            without the screen. We can walk hand in hand on the street, we can lean together to watch movies, and we can say to you at the end 
            of the day, "Baby, happy xxx." But before that day comes, please accept all my love, all my thoughts, and all my heartbeats.Take good 
            care of yourself over there. I will also work hard to live my life here. We will soon be in the same place to welcome our every festival.
            I love you, so far away but so close. </p>
